# RSA
A 256 bit implementation of the RSA algorithm
includes:
Key generator
Encryptor
Decryptor

****************
JAR files are the runnable version
JAVA files are the code

------KEYGEN------
Generates the public and private key and stores it in the specified location
Once keys are generated, they are used by the encryptor and decryptor to encrypt and decrypt messages
if the keys are regenerated, the encryption will have to be done again
------------------

------ENCRYPTOR------
This uses a text file (for now) as an input and the public key to encrypt the message.
once encrypted the message can then be stored as a text file.
To encrypt the message, the public key generated by the KEYGEN must be selected
---------------------

------DECRYPTOR------
This uses a text file (for now) as an input and the private key to decrypt the message.
To decrypt the message, the private key associated with the public key generated by the KEYGEN must be selected.
If a different private key is selected, the message will not be decrypted correctly.
